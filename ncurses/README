To run this

make

It will put a gocurses file into your directory that you can run
./gocurses

and if you have the required packages on your box you should be ok.

In ubuntu 11.04 you can find the ncurses.h header file in
libncurses5-dev: /usr/include/ncurses.h

Which you can install by doing
sudo aptitude install libncurses5-dev

If you are getting weird errors compiling make sure you have the prereq packages.
